When we talk about a sorting algorithm we mean a method or a set of instructions for rearranging an array in a way that can be considered sorted, either by index, value or alphabetical. We will be analysing various sorting algorithms and see how they perform, measured by how long it takes to fully sort an array or by how much of an array they can sort in a given time.
The algorithms we will be analysing are: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Quicksort, Quicksort using median of three as pivot, quicksort insertion sort hybrid, merge sort, merge sort insertion sort hybrid, built in python sort and built in numpy sort.
We are most interested in the time complexity these sorting algorithms give out by using big O(n) notation where n represents the number of elements in an array. Another factor that is notable when it comes to sorting algorithms is the amount of memory it can take to run one. In this paper we will be ignoring this factor and only be looking at the time complexity.
