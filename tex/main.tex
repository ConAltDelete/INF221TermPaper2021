\section{Introduction}

Hi, we are students. How are you?

\section{Theory}

In this section we will discuss the different algorithms, and their pros, and cons.

\section{Method used}

In this section we will show our workflow and automation of tests.

\section{Benchmarks}

In this section we will analyse the performance of the different algorithms on exponentially growing test data.

\section{Discussion}

We will in this section discuss our findings, and thoughts\footnote{Although these thoughts are subjective, we will present them as facts. For our thoughts feel real to us.}

\section{Acknowledgements}

We acknowledge that we may, or may not be made out of bread.
